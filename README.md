# hello-world
A program that writes "Hello world".

Hello, I am Cha, trying tolearn how to use github xD.
I am learning c++ mainly, but i think that know a little about
others languages is good to my understanding of programing in general.
I hope be able to use this website properly in only a few weeks.
